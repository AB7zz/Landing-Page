<h2 class="text-center">FAQs</h2>

<button class="accordion"><b>What is homeschooling?</b></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p><br>Simply speaking, homeschooling is when parents decide, for one reason or another, to opt out of the traditional public or
private school system and take charge of their child’s education — organizing subjects, teaching lessons (or arranging
tutors), evaluating progress and supervising social contacts and activities.</p>
</div>
<br>

<button class="accordion"><b>How do I know if homeschooling is right for me?</b></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p><br>The decision to home educate is a commitment, and commitments are most successful when they are entered into with
realistic expectations.</p>
</div>
<br>

<button class="accordion"><b>Do universities accept homeschooled students?</b></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p><br>Even if a homeschooled student has no standardized test scores or official transcripts to submit, many colleges are willing to accept their
application. If your homeschooled child is interested in going to college, you should start when they are in their early teens to research
colleges that are homeschool-friendly. Be sure to talk with admissions counselors at various colleges, some of whom are specifically assigned
to work with homeschooled applicants. Be sure you are clear about which application materials and pre-requisite classes the college of your
choice requires of homeschoolers before they can be admitted.</p>
</div>
<br>

<button class="accordion"><b>What are the benefits of homeschooling?</b></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p><br>There is no single list of benefits of homeschooling. Having said that, homeschooling meets specific needs for individual
families. Flexibility, academic benefits, efficiency and a plethora of opportunities are what homeschooling can offer. Parents
who choose to homeschool seek an education (and even a lifestyle) that’s not based on minimum standards, and a
one-size-fits-all approach.

Advantages may include:

<li>Individual attention</li>

<li>Curriculum choices</li>

<li>Socialization</li>

<li>Focused study time</li>

<li>Real-life education</li>

<li>Creativity and imagination</li></p>
</div>

<br>
<button class="accordion"><b>When can I homeschool my child?</b></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p><br>You can begin homeschooling your child anytime. Each state has different compulsory attendance requirements so be sure to check with
yours. Some parents start homeschooling as early as kindergarten, while others have their children attend public school for a few years and
then decide to homeschool for varying reasons. There really is no right or wrong time to homeschool. It all depends on your family’s needs.</p>
</div>

<br>
<button class="accordion"><b>Am I qualified to homeschool my children?</b></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p><br>You don’t have to be a trained teacher to manage your child’s homeschool and/or online learning program, but you must be prepared to
be completely dedicated to the effort and accept that the experience will include a lot of patience, hard work and time.</p>
</div>
<br>

<button class="accordion"><b>What homeschool curriculum is best for my child?</b></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p><br>This all depends on how your child learns best. Are they into technology and prefer to learn with an online program? Do they like to write
things out and use workbooks and textbooks? There are tons of homeschool curricula options available. Some families find that using
different programs and resources gives their children a well-rounded education and keeps them engaged.</p>
</div>

<br>
<button class="accordion"><b>What is the cost of homeschooling?</b></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p><br>Totally depends your choices - homeschooling can cost a little, or a lot. One can assume that homeschooling costs more than a traditional public school, but
less than a private school education. Practically, homeschooling could be managed for free (if one needed to) by using public resources like libraries,
educational TV/internet pages & shows, museums, and hand-me-down educational supplies. In general, homeschooling costs more if you use a complete
boxed curriculum (like Calvert or Oak Meadow), or sign up with an online study school (like BOS or Icademy). There are very affordable all-in-one online
curriculum services (like Time4Learning) that may just need to be supplemented with electives. Also, homeschooling costs tend to be higher for high school and
secondary, than for elementary school students. Since many homeschooled teens sometimes take college level courses, you will have to factor that into your
educational budget. Extracurricular activities such as sports, martial arts,

art lessons, etc will need a separate budget. Since homeschooled children have more time, they tend to participate in more of these activities. Bottom line?
(A) you have complete control over how much homeschooling will cost and (B) you can give your child a quality education no matter how much or how little
money you have.</p>
</div>

<br>
<button class="accordion"><b>What are some homeschooling pros and cons?</b></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p><br>Pros: For many homeschoolers, one of the greatest benefits of homeschooling is what I like to call ‘TOGETHERNESS’. Homeschooling families spend lots of
time learning and playing together, which naturally creates closeness amongst siblings, as well as the children and parents. Flexibility in how and what they
learn allows homeschooled children to learn about the “real world” by being part of it. These prime advantages allow homeschooled children to receive an
education that is fine-tuned specifically to their own needs, learning style, personality and interests.

B: Cons: According to feedback from homeschooling families, the biggest disadvantage facing them is the loss of income. Someone must be home, at least
part-time, to facilitate the children’s learning. At a time when it can often be difficult to get by on two incomes, it can be a real challenge to get by on just one.
Additionally, other difficulties include: lack of confidence in their own and their children’s abilities, public and/or family criticism, and adjusting career goals and
work schedules to accommodate the needs of the family. A very real challenge cited by homeschoolers is that of managing household chores. When your kids
are learning, playing, eating, and and and …. things can get a bit untidy. No worries, the art project in the corner, books spread across the floor and science
project in the sink are all pure evidence that learning is taking place … at HOME.</p>
</div>

<br>
<button class="accordion"><b>Will my homeschooled children be able to succeed in the “real world”?</b></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p><br>Many exploring homeschooling for the first time tend to worry that their child will not be able to function in the “real world” if they don’t attend school, and
have the same social experiences as traditionally schooled children. But what do schools REALLY do? They separate kids by age and ability, reinforce class and
gender stereotypes, and limit children’s interactions to group tasks, a few field trips per year (if that many), and short recess periods. School kids are forced to
socialize only with children their own age, and are trapped in a room (or 2) for 6-7 hours a day, allowed to view the outside world only through a textbook or
window. Where in the real world are adults forced to socialize with only someone their own age? Bullying and cruel teasing, consumerism, and competition are
often the social values children pick up at school. Homeschooled children are more likely to base their decisions on values they learn from their parents and
their faith, instead of feeling compelled to go along with the crowd and accept the behavior of what other children are displaying as the “norm.”</p>
